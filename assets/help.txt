Usage:

This application performs Huffman encoding and decoding.

Encoding:
1. Select a file to compress.
2. Choose an output file name.
3. Click 'Encode' to compress the file using Huffman encoding.

Decoding:
1. Select a Huffman-encoded file to decompress.
2. Choose an output file name.
3. Click 'Decode' to extract the original file.

Creating/Opening Huffman Encoder:
To ensure proper compression and extraction, the same Huffman encoder must be used. You can either:
1. Create a new encoder when compressing a file. This encoder will be embedded in the compressed file.
2. Open an existing encoder file. This is necessary when decompressing a file that was compressed with a specific encoder. Make sure the correct encoder file is selected.

Help:

About Huffman Encoding:

Huffman encoding is a lossless data compression algorithm that assigns variable-length codes to input characters based on their frequency. 
More frequent characters receive shorter codes, while less frequent characters receive longer codes. This leads to an overall reduction in the size of the encoded data.

Importance of Selecting Encoders:

Choosing the right encoder is crucial for efficient compression and extraction. A well-designed encoder optimizes the Huffman tree structure, resulting in a higher compression ratio. 
The encoder should also be reliable and ensure accurate decoding to prevent data loss or corruption.
